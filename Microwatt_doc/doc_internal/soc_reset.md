## Processes
- pll_reset_0: ( ext_clk )
**Description**
Wait for external clock to become stable before starting the PLL
By the time the FPGA has been loaded the clock should be well and
truly stable, but lets give it a few cycles to be sure.
[BenH] Some designs seem to require a lot more..

- soc_reset_0: ( pll_clk )
**Description**
Once our clock is stable and the external reset button isn't being
pressed, assert the SOC reset for long enough for the CPU pipeline
to clear completely.
