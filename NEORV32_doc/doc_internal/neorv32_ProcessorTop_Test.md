# << NEORV32 - Simple Test Setup >>                                                             #
# ********************************************************************************************* #
# This test setup instantiates the NEORV32 processor with a rather small configuration and only #
# propagates the UART and GPIO.out signals to the outer world.                                  #
# Only internal memories are used and the address space for instructions/data is constrained to #
# these memories.                                                                               #
