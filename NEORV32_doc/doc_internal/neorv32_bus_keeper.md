 # << NEORV32 - Bus Keeper (BUSKEEPER) >>                                                        #
 # ********************************************************************************************* #
 # This unit monitors the processor-internal bus. If the accessed INTERNAL (IMEM if enabled,     #
 # DMEM if enabled, BOOTROM + IO region) module does not respond within the defined number of    #
 # cycles (VHDL package: max_proc_int_response_time_c) the BUS KEEPER asserts the error signal   #
 # to inform the CPU / bus driver.                                                               #
 #                                                                                               #
 # WARNING: The bus keeper timeout does not track accesses via the processor-external bus        #
 #          interface! If the timeout-function of the Wishbone interface is not used, the CPU    #
 #          might be permanently stalled by an an unacknowledged transfer! If the external bus   #
 #          interface is disabled, ALL accesses by the CPU are internal.                         #
