## Processes
- host_access: ( clk_i )
**Description**
not used for this minimal example
Read/Write Access ----------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here we are reading/writing from/to the interface registers of the module. Please note that the peripheral/IO
modules of the NEORV32 can only be written in full word mode (32-bit). Any other write access (half-word or byte)
will trigger a store bus access fault exception.
The CFS provides up to 32 memory-mapped 32-bit interface register. For instance, these could be used to provide
a <control register> for global control of the unit, a <data register> for reading/writing from/to a data FIFO, a <command register>
for issuing commands and a <status register> for status information.
Following the interface protocol, each read or write access has to be acknowledged in the following cycle using the ack_o signal (or even later
if the module needs additional time; the maximum latency until an unacknowledged access will trigger a bus exception is defined via the package's
global "bus_timeout_c" constant). If no ACK is generated, the bus access will time out and cause a store bus access fault exception.
Host access: Read and write access to the interface registers + bus transfer acknowledge.
This example only implements four physical r/w register (the four lowest CF register). The remaining addresses of the CFS are not
associated with any writable or readable register - an access to those is simply ignored but still acknowledged.

- cfs_core: ( cfs_reg_wr )
**Description**
CFS Function Core ----------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is where the actual functionality can be implemented.
In this example we are just implementing four r/w registers that invert any value written to them.
