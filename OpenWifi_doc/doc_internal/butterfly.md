 Project:	A General Purpose Pipelined FFT Implementation

 Purpose:	This routine caculates a butterfly for a decimation
		in frequency version of an FFT.  Specifically, given
	complex Left and Right values together with a coefficient, the output
	of this routine is given by:

		L' = L + R
		R' = (L - R)*C

	The rest of the junk below handles timing (mostly), to make certain
	that L' and R' reach the output at the same clock.  Further, just to
	make certain that is the case, an 'aux' input exists.  This aux value
	will come out of this routine synchronized to the values it came in
	with.  (i.e., both L', R', and aux all have the same delay.)  Hence,
	a caller of this routine may set aux on the first input with valid
	data, and then wait to see aux set on the output to know when to find
	the first output with valid data.

	All bits are preserved until the very last clock, where any more bits
	than OWIDTH will be quietly discarded.

	This design features no overflow checking.

 Notes:
	CORDIC:
		Much as we might like, we can't use a cordic here.
		The goal is to accomplish an FFT, as defined, and a
		CORDIC places a scale factor onto the data.  Removing
		the scale factor would cost two multiplies, which
		is precisely what we are trying to avoid.


	3-MULTIPLIES:
		It should also be possible to do this with three multiplies
		and an extra two addition cycles.

		We want
			R+I = (a + jb) * (c + jd)
			R+I = (ac-bd) + j(ad+bc)
		We multiply
			P1 = ac
			P2 = bd
			P3 = (a+b)(c+d)
		Then
			R+I=(P1-P2)+j(P3-P2-P1)

		WIDTHS:
		On multiplying an X width number by an
		Y width number, X>Y, the result should be (X+Y)
		bits, right?
		-2^(X-1) <= a <= 2^(X-1) - 1
		-2^(Y-1) <= b <= 2^(Y-1) - 1
		(2^(Y-1)-1)*(-2^(X-1)) <= ab <= 2^(X-1)2^(Y-1)
		-2^(X+Y-2)+2^(X-1) <= ab <= 2^(X+Y-2) <= 2^(X+Y-1) - 1
		-2^(X+Y-1) <= ab <= 2^(X+Y-1)-1
		YUP!  But just barely.  Do this and you'll really want
		to drop a bit, although you will risk overflow in so
		doing.

	20150602 -- The sync logic lines have been completely redone.  The
		synchronization lines no longer go through the FIFO with the
		left hand sum, but are kept out of memory.  This allows the
		butterfly to use more optimal memory resources, while also
		guaranteeing that the sync lines can be properly reset upon
		any reset signal.

During the multiply,  values were multiplied by 2^(CWIDTH-2)*exp{-j*2*pi*...},  therefore, the left_x values need to be right shifted by  CWIDTH-2 as well.  The additional bits come from a sign  extension.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| MXMPYBITS    |                 | +2               |   Local/derived parameters that are calculated from the above  params.  Apart from algorithmic changes below, these should not  be adjusted<br>  The first step is to calculate how many clocks it takes our  multiply to come back with an answer within.  The time in the  multiply depends upon the input value with the fewest number of  bits--to keep the pipeline depth short.  So, let's find the  fewest number of bits here.  |
| LCLDELAY     |                 | MPYDELAY         |   In an environment when CKPCE > 1, the multiply delay isn't  necessarily the delay felt by this algorithm--measured in  i_ce's.  In particular, if the multiply can operate with more  operations per clock, it can appear to finish "faster".  Since most of the logic in this core operates on the slower  clock, we'll need to map that speed into the number of slower  clock ticks that it takes.                                 |
