| aux_s             | wire                               | These values are held in memory and delayed during the multiply.  Here, we recover them.  During the multiply, values were multiplied by 2^(CWIDTH-2)*exp{-j*2*pi*...}, therefore, the left_x values need to be right shifted by CWIDTH-2 as well.  The additional bits come from a sign extension.  |
