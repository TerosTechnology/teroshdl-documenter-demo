 Filename:	ifftmain.v

 Project:	A General Purpose Pipelined FFT Implementation

 Purpose:	This is the main module in the General Purpose FPGA FFT
		implementation.  As such, all other modules are subordinate
	to this one.  This module accomplish a fixed size Complex FFT on
	64 data points.
	The FFT is fully pipelined, and accepts as inputs one complex two's
	complement sample per clock.

 Parameters:
	i_clk	The clock.  All operations are synchronous with this clock.
	i_reset	Synchronous reset, active high.  Setting this line will
			force the reset of all of the internals to this routine.
			Further, following a reset, the o_sync line will go
			high the same time the first output sample is valid.
	i_ce	A clock enable line.  If this line is set, this module
			will accept one complex input value, and produce
			one (possibly empty) complex output value.
	i_sample	The complex input sample.  This value is split
			into two two's complement numbers, 16 bits each, with
			the real portion in the high order bits, and the
			imaginary portion taking the bottom 16 bits.
	o_result	The output result, of the same format as i_sample,
			only having 16 bits for each of the real and imaginary
			components, leading to 32 bits total.
	o_sync	A one bit output indicating the first sample of the FFT frame.
			It also indicates the first valid sample out of the FFT
			on the first frame.

 Arguments:	This file was computer generated using the following command
		line:

		% ./fftgen -v -i -d ../../ifft64 -f 64 -1 -k 1 -p 12 -n 16 -m 16

	This core will use hardware accelerated multiplies (DSPs)
	for 4 of the 6 stages

| IWIDTH  |      | 16    |  The bit-width of the input, IWIDTH, output, OWIDTH, and the log  of the FFT size.  These are localparams, rather than parameters,  because once the core has been generated, they can no longer be  changed.  (These values can be adjusted by running the core  generator again.)  The reason is simply that these values have  been hardwired into the core at several places.  |
| OWIDTH  |      | 16    |  The bit-width of the input, IWIDTH, output, OWIDTH, and the log  of the FFT size.  These are localparams, rather than parameters,  because once the core has been generated, they can no longer be  changed.  (These values can be adjusted by running the core  generator again.)  The reason is simply that these values have  been hardwired into the core at several places.  |
| LGWIDTH |      | 6     |  The bit-width of the input, IWIDTH, output, OWIDTH, and the log  of the FFT size.  These are localparams, rather than parameters,  because once the core has been generated, they can no longer be  changed.  (These values can be adjusted by running the core  generator again.)
