## Description

Filename:	fftstage.v
 Project:	A General Purpose Pipelined FFT Implementation
 Purpose:	This file is (almost) a Verilog source file.  It is meant to
 Operation:
 	Given a stream of values, operate upon them as though they were
 	value pairs, x[n] and x[n+N/2].  The stream begins when n=0, and ends
 	when n=N/2-1 (i.e. there's a full set of N values).  When the value
 	x[0] enters, the synchronization input, i_sync, must be true as well.
 	For this stream, produce outputs
 	y[n    ] = x[n] + x[n+N/2], and
 	y[n+N/2] = (x[n] - x[n+N/2]) * c[n],
 			where c[n] is a complex coefficient found in the
 			external memory file COEFFILE.
 	When y[0] is output, a synchronization bit o_sync will be true as
 	well, otherwise it will be zero.
 	Most of the work to do this is done within the butterfly, whether the
 	hardware accelerated butterfly (uses a DSP) or not.

| CKPCE        |       | 1             | Clocks per CE.  If your incoming data rate is less than 50% of your clock speed, you can set CKPCE to 2'b10, make sure there's at least one clock between cycles when i_ce is high, and then use two multiplies instead of three.  Setting CKPCE to 2'b11, and insisting on at least two clocks with i_ce low between cycles with i_ce high, then the hardware optimized butterfly code will used one multiply instead of two.  |

| idle            | reg                   | The idle register is designed to keep track of when an input to the butterfly is important and going to be used.  It's used in a flag following, so that when useful values are placed into the butterfly they'll be non-zero (idle=0), otherwise when the inputs to the butterfly are irrelevant and will be ignored, then (idle=1) those inputs will be set to zero.  This functionality is not designed to be used in operation, but only within a Verilator simulation context when chasing a bug. In this limited environment, the non-zero answers will stand in a trace making it easier to highlight a bug.  |

- unnamed: ( @(posedge i_clk) )

**Description**
Need to make certain here that we don't read
- unnamed: ( @(posedge i_clk) )
- unnamed: ( @(posedge i_clk) )
**Description**
Read the values from our input memory, and use them to feed first of two
butterfly inputs

- unnamed: ( @(posedge i_clk) )
- unnamed: ( @(posedge i_clk) )
- unnamed: ( @(posedge i_clk) )
**Description**
Only write to the memory on the first half of the outputs
We'll use the memory value on the second half of the outputs
