 Entity:					This module detects whether all bit positions of a std_logic_vector have the same value.

 Description:
 -------------------------------------
 This circuit may, for instance, be used to detect the first sign change
 and, thus, the range of a two's complement number.

 These components may be chained by using the output of the predecessor as
 guard input. This chaining allows to have intermediate results available
 while still ensuring the use of a fast carry chain on supporting FPGA
 architectures. When chaining, make sure to overlap both vector slices by one
 bit position as to avoid an undetected sign change between the slices.
