Entity:					TRNG - True Random Number Generator.
Description:
------------
This module implements a true random number generator based on sampling
combinational loops of interleaved X(N)OR gates.
Always verify the randomness of this TRNG implementation for your concrete
target platform, for instance, using the dieharder test by Robert G. Brown
[http://www.phy.duke.edu/~rgb/General/dieharder.php], which is also
directly available for many GNU/Linux distributions, e.g. Debian. Ideally,
randomness would be verified for varying operating conditions.
This design involves fast-switching combinational loops on purpose so as
to serve as sources of entropoy. This implies a relevant local power
consumption. Do not cramp large parts of a chip with these TRNGs without
ensuring appropriate heat dissipation. It often requires special
constraints or directives to enforce the proper synthesis of these
combinational loops by the tools.
