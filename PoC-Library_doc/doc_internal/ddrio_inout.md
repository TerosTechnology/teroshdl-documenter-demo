Entity:					Chip-Specific DDR Input and Output Registers
Description:
-------------------------------------
Instantiates chip-specific :abbr:`DDR (Double Data Rate)` input and output
registers.
Both data ``DataOut_high/low`` as well as ``OutputEnable`` are sampled with
the ``rising_edge(Clock)`` from the on-chip logic. ``DataOut_high`` is brought
out with this rising edge. ``DataOut_low`` is brought out with the falling
edge.
``OutputEnable`` (Tri-State) is high-active. It is automatically inverted if
necessary. Output is disabled after power-up.
Both data ``DataIn_high/low`` are synchronously outputted to the on-chip logic
with the rising edge of ``Clock``. ``DataIn_high`` is the value at the ``Pad``
sampled with the same rising edge. ``DataIn_low`` is the value sampled with
the falling edge directly before this rising edge. Thus sampling starts with
the falling edge of the clock as depicted in the following waveform.

``Pad`` must be connected to a PAD because FPGAs only have these registers in
IOBs.
