FSM for resetting the GTX/GTH/GTP in the 7-series. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>  Following steps are performed:  1) Only for GTX - After configuration wait for approximately 500 ns as specified in     answer-record 43482  2) Assert all resets on the GT and on an MMCM potentially connected.     After that wait until a reference-clock has been detected.  3) Release the reset to the GT and wait until the GT-PLL has locked.  4) Release the MMCM-reset and wait until the MMCM has signalled lock.     Also signal to the RX-side which PLL has been reset.  5) Wait for the RESET_DONE-signal from the GT.  6) Signal to start the phase-alignment procedure and wait for it to     finish.  7) Reset-sequence has successfully run through. Signal this to the     rest of the design by asserting TX_FSM_RESET_DONE.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



 Following steps are performed:

 1) Only for GTX - After configuration wait for approximately 500 ns as specified in

    answer-record 43482

 2) Assert all resets on the GT and on an MMCM potentially connected.

    After that wait until a reference-clock has been detected.

 3) Release the reset to the GT and wait until the GT-PLL has locked.

 4) Release the MMCM-reset and wait until the MMCM has signalled lock.

    Also signal to the RX-side which PLL has been reset.

 5) Wait for the RESET_DONE-signal from the GT.

 6) Signal to start the phase-alignment procedure and wait for it to

    finish.

 7) Reset-sequence has successfully run through. Signal this to the

    rest of the design by asserting TX_FSM_RESET_DONE.
