  Description :     This module is the ppm monitor between the
  		      GT RxRecClk and the reference clock

                    This module will declare that the Rx RECCLK is stable if the
                    recovered clock is within +/-5000PPM of the reference clock.


                    There are 3 counters running on local clocks for both
                    recovered clocks and one for the reference clock.  The
                    COUNTER_UPPER_VALUE parameter is the width of these
                    counters. The PPM offset is checked when these counters
                    roll over.

                    There is also a counter running on the system clock.
                    This can be running at a much lower frequency and is
                    running on a BUFG.

                    To set the parameters correctly here is what you need to
                    do.  Lets assume taht the reference and recovered
                    clocks are running at 156MHz and the system clock is
                    running at 50MHz.

                    To ensure that the interval is long enough we want to
                    to make the COUNTER_UPPER_VALUE to be reasonable.  The
                    CLOCK_PULSES is the number of sytem clock cycles we can
                    expect to be off based on these frequencies:

                    Example: Rec Clk and Ref Clk 156MHz, System clock 50MHz
                             PPM Offset to tolerate +/- 5000PPM

                    COUNTER_UPPER_VALUE = 15 -> 2^15 counter = 32768
                    GCLK_COUNTER_UPPER_VALUE = 15 -> 2^15 counter = 32768

                    PPM OFFSET = 5000 => 32768 * 5000/1000000 = 164

                    Now we are using the system clock to do the
                    calculations, therfore we need to scale the PPM_OFFSET
                    accordingly.

                    CLOCK_PULSES = PPM_OFFSET * sysclk_freq/refclk_freq
                                 = 164 * 50/156 = 52


                    When the counters are checked if they are off by less
                    than 52, we can delcare that the particular RECCLK is
                    stable.

                    All FFs that have the _meta are metastability FFs and
                    can be ignored from a timing perspective. The following
                    constraint can be added to the UCF to ensure that they
                    are ignored:

                    INST "*_meta" TNM = "METASTABILITY_FFS";
                    TIMESPEC "TS_METASTABILITY" = FROM FFS TO "METASTABILITY_FFS" TIG;
