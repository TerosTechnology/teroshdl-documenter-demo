  Description : The logic below implements the procedure to do automatic phase-alignment
                on the 7-series GTX as described in ug476pdf, version 1.3,
                Chapters "Using the TX Phase Alignment to Bypass the TX Buffer"
                and "Using the RX Phase Alignment to Bypass the RX Elastic Buffer"
                Should the logic below differ from what is described in a later version
                of the user-guide, you are using an auto-alignment block, which is
                out of date and needs to be updated for safe operation.
