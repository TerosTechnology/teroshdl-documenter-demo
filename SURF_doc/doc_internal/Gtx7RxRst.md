## Processes
- unnamed: ( STABLE_CLOCK )
- retries_recclk_monitor: ( STABLE_CLOCK )
- timeouts: ( STABLE_CLOCK )
- mmcm_lock_wait: ( RXUSERCLK, MMCM_LOCK )
- timeout_buffer_bypass: ( RXUSERCLK )
- reset_fsm: ( STABLE_CLOCK )
**Description**
Following steps are performed:
1) After configuration wait for approximately 500 ns as specified in
   answer-record 43482
2) Assert all resets on the GT and on an MMCM potentially connected.
   After that wait until a reference-clock has been detected.
3) Release the reset to the GT and wait until the GT-PLL has locked.
4) Release the MMCM-reset and wait until the MMCM has signalled lock.
   Also get info from the TX-side which PLL has been reset.
5) Wait for the RESET_DONE-signal from the GT.
6) Signal to start the phase-alignment procedure and wait for it to
   finish.
7) Reset-sequence has successfully run through. Signal this to the
   rest of the design by asserting RX_FSM_RESET_DONE.
