 ***************************************************************************
 A 4-wire to 3-wire SPI converter, supporting maximum 8 slaves.
 The expected transfer format is defined in ADI_SPI technical specification
 (https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/technical-guides/adispi_rev_1p0_customer.pdf)
 16 bit instruction followed by N x 8 bits of data; the MSB bit of the
 instruction defines the direction of the SDIO during data transfer. (READ
 is 1 and WRITE is 0)
