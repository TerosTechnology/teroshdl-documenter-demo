## Processes
- unnamed: ( @(posedge clk) )
**Description**
first data on de assertion is cb (0x0), then cr (0x1).
previous data is held when not current

- unnamed: ( @(posedge clk) )
**Description**
pipe line stages

- unnamed: ( @(s422_de_2d, s422_de, s422_CbCr, s422_CbCr_2d) )
**Description**
If both the left and the right sample are valid do the average, otherwise
use the only valid.

- unnamed: ( @(posedge clk) )
**Description**
444 outputs
