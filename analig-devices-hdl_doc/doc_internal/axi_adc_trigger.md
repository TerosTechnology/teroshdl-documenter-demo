## Processes
- unnamed: ( @(*) )
- unnamed: ( @(posedge clk) )
**Description**
External trigger output hold 100000 clock cycles(1ms) on polarity change.
All trigger signals that are to be outputted on the external trigger after a
trigger out is acknowledged by the hold counter will be disregarded for 1ms.
This was done to avoid noise created by high frequency switches on long
wires.

- unnamed: ( @(posedge clk) )
**Description**
1. keep data in sync with the trigger. The trigger bypasses the variable
fifo. The data goes through and it is delayed with 4 clock cycles)
2. For non max sample rate of the ADC, the trigger signal that originates
from an external source is stored until the valid acknowledges the trigger.
