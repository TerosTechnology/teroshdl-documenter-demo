## Processes
- unnamed: ( @(posedge dac_clk) )
- unnamed: ( @(posedge dac_clk) )
- unnamed: ( @(posedge dac_clk) )
**Description**
- for start synchronized, wait until the DMA has valid data on both channels
- for non synchronized channels the start of transmission gets the 2 data
paths randomly ready, only when using data buffers

- unnamed: ( @(posedge dac_clk) )
- unnamed: ( @(posedge dac_clk) )
- unnamed: ( @(posedge dac_clk) )
- unnamed: ( @(*) )
