**Description**
If the STAT register is included in the sample we get 4 bytes per sample and
 * are able to detect channel swaps and synchronize the first output sample to
 * the first channel. If the STAT register is not included we only get 3 bytes
 * per sample and rely on that the first sample will always be from the first
 * channel */
