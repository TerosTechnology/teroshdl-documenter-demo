  + A simple AXI stream data upscale module, which can be used with devices
    with resolution which can not be aligned to a WORD (32 bits). Eg. 24 bits
  + It has the same control interface as the ad_datafmt module, which controls
    the data format inside a generic AXI converter core.
  + Supports multiple channels. Contains a single register stage.
