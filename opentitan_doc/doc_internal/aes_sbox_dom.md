 AES S-Box with First-Order Domain-Oriented Masking
 This is the unpipelined version using DOM-dep multipliers. It has a latency of 5 clock cycles
 and requires 28 bits of pseudo-random data per evaluation. Pipelining would only be beneficial
 when using
 - either a cipher core architecture with a data path smaller than 128 bit, i.e., where the
   individual S-Boxes are evaluated more than once per round, or
 - a fully unrolled cipher core architecture for maximum throughput.
 Note: The DOM AES S-Box is built on top of the Canright masked S-Box without mask re-use.
 For details, see the following papers and reports:

     Protection Order" available at https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/486.pdf

 Using the Coco-Alma tool in transient mode, this implementation has been formally verified to be
 secure against first-order side-channel analysis (SCA). For more information on the tool,
 refer to the following papers:

     available at https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1294.pdf

 IMPORTANT NOTE:                                                                               //
                            DO NOT USE THIS FOR SYNTHESIS BLINDLY!                             //
                                                                                               //
 This implementation relies on primitive cells like prim_buf/flop_en containing tool-specific  //
 synthesis attributes to prevent the synthesis tool from optimizing away/re-ordering registers //
 and to enforce the correct ordering of operations. Without the proper primitives, synthesis   //
 tools might heavily optimize the design. The result is likely insecure. Use with care.        //
 Packed struct for pseudo-random data (PRD) distribution. Stages 1, 3 and 4 require 8 bits each.
 Stage 2 requires just 4 bits.
 DOM-indep GF(2^N) multiplier, first-order masked.
 Computes (a_q ^ b_q) = (a_x ^ b_x) * (a_y ^ b_y), i.e. q = x * y using first-order
 domain-oriented masking. The sharings of x and y are required to be uniformly random and
 independent from each other.
