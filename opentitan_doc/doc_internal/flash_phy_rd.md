 Flash Phy Read Module
 This module implements the flash phy read pipeline.
 The read pipeline consists of read buffers, the actual flash read stage, the
 descrambling stage, and finally the response.
 Note this module backpressures the front end, but cannot handle any back end
 back pressuring at the response stage.  It is thus assumed it will tell the
 upstream to stop issuing instructions, however once issued, the upstream will
 always accept the response.
 Support for descramble stage
 The allocate and descramble indication received at read stage are saved.
 When the read completes, depending on the 'descramble' indication saved, the
 data is either stored into FIFO (reg + skid) between read and descramble stage,
 or forwarded directly to the buffer (no de-scramble)
 If the storage element between read and de-scramble stages are completely full
 for any reason, then the read stage cannot start.
 When the read stage begins, the galois multiply portion of the de-scramble is
 also kicked off. When the galois multiply stage AND read stage completes, the
 de-scramble is then kicked off.

## Processes
- unnamed: ( @(posedge clk_i or negedge rst_ni) )
**Description**
buffer enable cannot be changed unless the entire read pipeline is idle

- unnamed: ( @(posedge clk_i or negedge rst_ni) )
- unnamed: ( @(posedge clk_i or negedge rst_ni) )
**Description**
generate the mask calculation request
mask calculation is done in parallel to the read stage

- unnamed: (  )
**Description**
select among the buffers

## Instantiations

- i_rsp_order_fifo: prim_fifo_sync
**Description**
response order FIFO

- u_rd_storage: prim_fifo_sync
- u_mask_storage: prim_fifo_sync
**Description**
storage for mask calculations
