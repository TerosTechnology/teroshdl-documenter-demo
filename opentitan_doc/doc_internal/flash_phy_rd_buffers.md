 Flash Phy Read Buffers
 This module implements the read buffers
 These buffers are straightforward flip flop storage.
 There are 3 inputs, alloc, upate and wipe.
 Alloc happens when a buffer is allocated, the state transitions to WIP.
 Update happens when a buffer has already been allocated, and is now being updated with data, the
 state transitions to VALID.
 Wipe happens when a buffer is wiped due to a program being issued to the same location, the
 state transitions to INVALID
 Basically...this is a tag ram + data ram combined into one
