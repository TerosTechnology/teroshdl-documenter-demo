 This module decodes a differentially encoded signal and detects
 incorrectly encoded differential states.
 In case the differential pair crosses an asynchronous boundary, it has
 to be re-synchronized to the local clock. This can be achieved by
 setting the AsyncOn parameter to 1'b1. In that case, two additional
 input registers are added (to counteract metastability), and
 a pattern detector is instantiated that detects skewed level changes on
 the differential pair (i.e., when level changes on the diff pair are
 sampled one cycle apart due to a timing skew between the two wires).
