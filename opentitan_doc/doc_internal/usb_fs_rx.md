| line_state_d        | logic [2:0]  | ////////////////////  usb receive path // //////////////////// /////////////////////////////////////  line state recovery state machine // /////////////////////////////////////  If the receive path is set not to use a differential reciever:  There is a chance that one of the differential pairs will appear to have  changed to the new state while the other is still in the old state.  the  following state machine detects transitions and waits an extra sampling clock  before decoding the state on the differential pair.  this transition period  will only ever last for one clock as long as there is no noise on the line.  if there is enough noise on the line then the data may be corrupted and the  packet will fail the data integrity checks.
