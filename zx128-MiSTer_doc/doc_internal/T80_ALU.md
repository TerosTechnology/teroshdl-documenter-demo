## Description
****
T80(c) core. Attempt to finish all undocumented features and provide
             accurate timings.
Version 350.
Copyright (c) 2018 Sorgelig
 Test passed: ZEXDOC, ZEXALL, Z80Full(*), Z80memptr
 (*) Currently only SCF and CCF instructions aren't passed X/Y flags check as
     correct implementation is still unclear.
****
T80(b) core. In an effort to merge and maintain bug fixes ....
Ver 301 parity flag is just parity for 8080, also overflow for Z80, by Sean Riddle

Limitations :
File history :
     0214 : Fixed mostly flags, only the block instructions now fail the zex regression test
     0238 : Fixed zero flag for 16 bit SBC and ADC
     0240 : Added GB operations
     0242 : Cleanup
     0247 : Cleanup
