## Description

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ****
 T80(c) core. Attempt to finish all undocumented features and provide
              accurate timings.
 Version 350.
 Copyright (c) 2018 Sorgelig
  Test passed: ZEXDOC, ZEXALL, Z80Full(*), Z80memptr
  (*) Currently only SCF and CCF instructions aren't passed X/Y flags check as
      correct implementation is still unclear.

 ****
 T80(b) core. In an effort to merge and maintain bug fixes ....

 Ver 303 add undocumented DDCB and FDCB opcodes by TobiFlex 20.04.2010
 Ver 300 started tidyup
 MikeJ March 2005
