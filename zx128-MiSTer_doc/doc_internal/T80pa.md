File history :
v1.0: convert to preudo-asynchronous model with original Z80 timings.
v2.0: rewritten for more precise timings.
      support for both CEN_n and CEN_p set to 1. Effective clock will be CLK/2.
v2.1: Output Address 0 during non-bus MCycle (fix ZX contention)
v2.2: Interrupt acknowledge cycle has been corrected
      WAIT_n is broken in T80.vhd. Simulate correct WAIT_n locally.
v2.3: Output last used Address during non-bus MCycle seems more correct.
